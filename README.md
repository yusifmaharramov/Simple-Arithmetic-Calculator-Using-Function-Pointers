This program is used to make arithmetic calculations of 2 numbers for example addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I've used function pointers to build the program. It's a very simple program and it's for beginners. This is a very precise application of function pointers. Function pointers can be used in such cases that requires calling a function at a run time unlike at compilation time.
